# Lecture 04 - Pattern Problems

In this lecture, we explored **Pattern Printing** problems in C++. These problems help improve logical thinking and control over loops.

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- Pattern problem-solving strategy
- Nested `for` loops
- Breaking down problems into rows and columns
- Pattern flow using spaces, numbers, and symbols

## 🧪 Practiced Patterns:
- Solid Rectangle
- Hollow Rectangle
- Half Pyramid
- Inverted Half Pyramid
- Numeric Half Pyramid
- Floyd’s Triangle
- 0-1 Pattern

## 📁 File:
- `pattern.cpp`

## 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Loop control in 2D format
- Printing logic for stars (`*`), numbers, and spaces
- Importance of dry-running patterns before coding
