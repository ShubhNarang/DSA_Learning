This folder contains code and notes from **Lecture 03** of the CodeHelp DSA series.

## 📝 Topics Covered
- `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
- `while` loops
- Introduction to pattern printing
- Prime number check logic

## 📂 Files Included

- `if_else.cpp` – Demonstrates conditional branching
- `while_loop.cpp` – Understanding loops and iteration
- `prime.cpp` – Logic to check for prime numbers
- `pattern.cpp` – Basic pattern printing using nested loops

## 📌 Note
This lecture introduces flow control through conditionals and loops.  
It also builds pattern-solving logic, which is essential for coding interviews.
